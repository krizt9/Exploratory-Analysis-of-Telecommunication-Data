# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Telecommunication-Data
Bachelor's thesis at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en) in Zagreb.

I received a sample of a million call records from a real data set of calls from a telecommunication company where a lot of data was masked due to privacy protection reasons. I analysed the information about the calls and got to some interesting conclusions of which the most interesting would perhaps be that people tend to send more calls on working days, but those calls would be a lot shorter than during the weekend which means that work behaviour of people is one of the biggest influencers on the number of calls and their duration. 

The paper is written only in the Croatian language.
